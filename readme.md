# React Email Starter

## Thanks for the help ðŸ˜Š

Starting the dev server and modifying `test.tsx` in the components directory does not result in the preview changing.

On my end, I'm seeing the file be duplicated a directory up in the .`react-email/emails` folder

I haven't changed anything related to configuration
